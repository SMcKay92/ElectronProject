Issue: Add Window not communicating with Main window or Log, and errors with app seeing jquery and or require.

Causes: various + issues related to security updates when using newer versions (e.g. npm 7.24.0+, electron 15.0.0+, node 14.17.6+) 

Solution: See changes / suggestions made below:


1) Removed reference to external css.


2) If it can't find jquery, at your projects npm prompt type:

npm install -g jquery 
npm install --save jquery

3) If it can't find require or gives no errors (versioning issue) then in Main.js for both Main and Add windows add:    
 
webPreferences: {
      nodeIntegration: true,
      contextIsolation: false  
  }

4) Verify that this line of code in the Main window script does not have the word "item" in it.

It should look similar to:  var allInput=["name: "+name, "Category : "+category];
